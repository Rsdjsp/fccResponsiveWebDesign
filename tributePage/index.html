                    <strong>1906</strong> The first and only career that the Grand Prix
                    name was organized by the Automobile Club of France (CAF) and it ran
                    for two days in the middle of June.

                    <strong>1924</strong> The Association Internationale des Automobile
                    Clubs Reconnus (AIACR), whose mission was to regularly regulate the
                    GG.PP. However, these regulations were abandoned in 1928, in an era
                    known as 'Free Formula'

                    <strong>1933</strong> The Monaco GP was the first time in the
                    history of the sport that the starting order was decided through
                    qualifying times. All competing vehicles were painted in their
                    national colors, although in 1934, the Germans stopped painting
                    their racing cars (Auto Union and Mercedes-Benz), in an effort to
                    reduce the weight of the car.

                    <strong>1950</strong> Several Grands Prix came together to create
                    the World Championship of Formula 1 Drivers. A scoring system and
                    agreed to a total of seven eligible races for such a celebration.
                    The first race of the World Cup was held on May 13 at the
                    Silverstone circuit (UK).
